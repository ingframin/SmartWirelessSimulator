# SmartWirelessSimulator_MAS_Project2018

This program simulates a self-configuring wireless network where the nodes decide an energy optimal distribution of access point nodes and stations.
The constraints are:
 - limited visibility between nodes
 - each access point can serve at most N stations
 - each node has limited battery life
 
 ## Dependencies:
 Python3
 
 ## Run
 $: python3 main.py
